# Verify discipline

## Focused checks for executors

1. Find the project's real commands in its documented scripts. Do not guess flags.
2. Pick the closest consumer, regression input, or test that can fail for the behavior you changed.
3. Run that focused check while editing. A nontrivial behavior change needs the smallest meaningful
   runnable regression, not an invented test count.
4. When the related edits are current, run the ticket's exact verifier and report the behavior and
   assertion or consumer it exercised. Do not claim broader coverage ran when it did not.

The orchestrator runs one combined full gate after integration. An executor does not run or schedule a
broad suite unless the ticket's contract specifically requires it. A safety-sensitive contract can
require independent review when it names the untested seam that needs scrutiny.

## Keep the result readable

The exit code is the verdict. Redirect long commands to a log and show the status and failures; read
only the relevant log range on failure. Preserve the command's exit code when filtering output.

If no focused form exists, use the smallest documented check that covers the change. Do not make a
full suite an edit loop.
