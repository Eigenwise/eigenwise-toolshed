# CRAP gate

CRAP means Change Risk Anti-Patterns, from Alberto Savoia and Bob Evans' 2007 paper. It gives
one number to a function's branching complexity and test coverage:

```text
crap = cc^2 * (1 - coverage)^3 + cc
```

`cc` is cyclomatic complexity. A fully tested function scores its complexity. An untested function
scores roughly its complexity squared. The classic CRAP ceiling is 30. Quartermaster starts at 6,
which keeps every function either small or tested.

## Threshold policy

The threshold is fixed at 6, and 6 fails. The gate compares against the configured base revision and
checks only functions the change added or modified. Untouched legacy functions, including functions in
a changed file, never fail or appear in the failure list. A changed function below 6 passes even when
its prior score was lower.

## Prerequisite

Quartermaster needs [lizard](https://github.com/terryyin/lizard) to measure complexity. It never
installs lizard. If it is missing, the command exits 2 and prints this hint:

```text
uv tool install lizard
pipx install lizard
pip install lizard
```

Exit 2 also covers a missing LCOV file, a configured coverage command that fails, or an unverified
measurement. A file where lizard finds zero functions despite function-like source tokens, or a changed
function without coverage data, is unverified rather than a pass. A file covered by a configured
`exclude` pattern is never treated as unverified, even with zero lizard rows and function-like tokens.
Fix the printed problem, then run the gate again.

## Produce LCOV coverage

Pick the row for the detected stack and use its output path in `lcov`. The test command is still the
project's own command. Some stacks need a one-time formatter or converter setup before the command
can write LCOV.

| Stack | Recipe |
| --- | --- |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `c8 --reporter=lcov <test command>` writes `coverage/lcov.info` by default. For example: `c8 --reporter=lcov npm test`. |
| Python | `coverage run -m pytest && coverage lcov -o coverage/lcov.info` |
| Go | `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && gcov2lcov -infile coverage.out -outfile coverage/lcov.info` |
| Rust | `cargo llvm-cov --lcov --output-path coverage/lcov.info` |
| Java / Kotlin | First configure JaCoCo to write `coverage/jacoco.xml`. Convert it through [jcc2c](https://github.com/cjmach/jcc2c) and LCOV's `xml2lcov`: `java -jar jcc2c.jar -i coverage/jacoco.xml -o coverage/cobertura.xml src/main/java && xml2lcov -o coverage/lcov.info coverage/cobertura.xml`. Use `src/main/kotlin` for a Kotlin-only project. |
| C / C++ | `gcovr --lcov coverage/lcov.info` |
| C# | `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" -- DataCollectionRunSettings.DataCollectors.DataCollector.Configuration.Format=lcov` writes `coverage.info` below `TestResults`; point `lcov` at that generated file. |
| Ruby | Add `simplecov-lcov`, configure its single-file formatter with `single_report_path = 'coverage/lcov.info'`, then run the normal test command, such as `bundle exec rake test`. |
| PHP | `vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover coverage/clover.xml && vendor/bin/clover-to-lcov coverage/clover.xml -o coverage/lcov.info`. PHPUnit writes Clover, not LCOV, so this uses [`laxit/clover-to-lcov`](https://packagist.org/packages/laxit/clover-to-lcov) for the honest conversion step. |

## Config and rule

Create `.claude/quartermaster/crap.json`. Every key is optional and command-line flags override it.

```json
{
  "coverageCommand": "npx c8 --reporter=lcov npm test",
  "lcov": "coverage/lcov.info",
  "sources": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["**/*.test.*"],
  "base": "main"
}
```

The defaults are `coverage/lcov.info`, sources `.`, no exclusions, threshold 6, the repository's
`develop`, `main`, or `master` branch as the base, and no coverage command. Use `--lcov`,
`--complexity`, or `--coverage-command` for a one-off override. `base` in the config selects the
revision used to identify changed functions. The shared parser and score implementation lives under
`scripts/quality`; Quartermaster only supplies project-specific LCOV and command wiring.

```text
node "<quartermaster plugin root>/bin/quartermaster.js" crap --project "<project>"
```

Use this live rule after the command has passed:

```markdown
---
description: Keep changed code within the CRAP ceiling
priority: 85
---
Before calling a change done, run `node "<quartermaster plugin root>/bin/quartermaster.js" crap --project "<project>"`.
Keep every new or modified function strictly below 6. Cover it or split it. Untouched legacy functions are out of scope.
Exit 2 means a prerequisite or measurement is missing. Follow the printed install or measurement hint, then rerun the gate. Do not skip it.
```
