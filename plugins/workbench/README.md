*Part of the [eigenwise-toolshed](../../README.md), a small marketplace of Claude Code plugins by [Eigenwise](https://eigenwise.io).*

Workbench owns the lifecycle of a Claude Code workspace: set it up, keep its plugins current, check local health, and improve the workflow after real use.

## Install

Install Workbench once at user scope. It stays outside generated project settings, so a workspace never loads a second project-scoped copy or duplicate hooks.

```text
/plugin marketplace add Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed
/plugin install workbench@eigenwise-toolshed --scope user
```

Reload plugins or restart Claude Code after installing.

## Skills

- **`init-workspace`** sets up a project-side `.claude/` directory through a short interview. It generates settings, rules, structure notes, and a codebase map where appropriate. Generated `enabledPlugins` never includes Workbench itself.
- **`update-toolshed`** refreshes marketplaces, updates recorded user, project, and local installs, checks the Codex gateway, and prints reload advice. Run it first with `--check` for a read-only report.
- **`workbench-doctor`** is the read-only health check. It combines updater check mode with the session health audit and reports the next useful repair step.
- **`retro`** reviews recurring session friction and proposes small, durable workspace improvements.

Bare skill names work as usual: `/init-workspace`, `/update-toolshed`, `/workbench-doctor`, and `/retro`. Qualified invocations use `/workbench:<skill>` when needed.

## Update and health

The updater changes installed plugins, so it is always user-invoked rather than automatic:

```sh
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/update-toolshed.js" --check
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/update-toolshed.js"
```

After updates, reload every session that had an affected plugin loaded. Workbench also reports legacy `workspace-init@eigenwise-toolshed` and `toolshed-guard@eigenwise-toolshed` installs with the exact uninstall command for their recorded scope and project directory.
